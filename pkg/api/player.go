	// Example from player.html's JS: `const videoSrc = queryParams.get('url');`
	//
	// If `player.html` were to use server-rendered Go template variables (e.g., `[[ .Host ]]`),
	// then the data from `reqToMapFiber` (or relevant parts of it) would need to be passed here.
	// This would require `reqToMapFiber` to be in a shared package or data passed via `c.Locals()`.
	//
	// For this refactoring step, we'll assume `player.html` does not require server-side Go template
	// variable injection for its core functionality, relying on its own JS.
	// Thus, we render it with `nil` data.
